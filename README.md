## Abstract

Single-field-of-view (FoV) histopathological image classification is vital for colorectal cancer (CRC) diagnosis in mid- to low-tier hospitals lacking whole-slide imaging (WSI) scanners and storage, yet suffers from severe class imbalance and degraded performance. To address this, we propose a dual-level imbalance mitigation (DIM) framework integrating data-level and algorithm-level approaches. Specifically:  
1. **Data-level approach:** A global context generative adversarial network (GCGAN) generates realistic minority-class images for augmentation to balance the dataset.  
2. **Algorithm-level approach:** A frequency-aware adaptive focal loss (FAFL) applies a frequency-aware offset and adaptive modulation to better separate overlapping classes.  
3. **Classification model:** A lightweight receptive field-based convolutional neural network (LRF-CNN) is trained under DIM to leverage both augmentation and loss modulation for improved classification.

Extensive experiments on single-FoV CRC datasets demonstrate that DIM-equipped LRF-CNN outperforms five state-of-the-art models (SOTA) across multiple metrics. Furthermore, each DIM component enhances performance when applied individually to those models, and additional validation on diverse histopathological datasets confirms the generalizability and effectiveness of the proposed DIM framework.
